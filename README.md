# Citybike analysis
## Overview
The purpose of the analysis is to solidify a business proposal for bike-sharing program. The bike trip analysis will be shown to stakeholders in order to proof sustainability and perspective of the project.

## Results
- During the analysis we created several plots, reflecting current situation in the business. On the first page performed data showing distribution of rides between genders during the every day of week and the quantity of rides relatively to its duration. [Checkout times for Users by Gender](https://github.com/andgerashchenko/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/checkout%20times.png)

- In order to determine peak hours and days of week, the following plots were made: [Trips per hour and weekday for Genders](https://github.com/andgerashchenko/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/trips%20each%20hour%20by%20weekday.png)
Here you can see how many rides occure in particular hour on each weekday, separated by genders. For clearer understanding different types of plots has been used.

- Next set of plots gives picture of what weekday is mostly popular for bikesharing among different types of customers and genders: [Checkout chance by weekday](https://github.com/andgerashchenko/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/trips%20by%20weekday.png)
The pie chart shows persantage probability of bike checkout for each group. Second plot shows the same analysis in absolute values in comparison between groupes using colors.

- The last page compares plots showing starting and ending locations, using map and colored bubbles reflecting more or less popular stations: [Start/End Locations](https://github.com/andgerashchenko/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/locations.png)
